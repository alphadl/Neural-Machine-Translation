previous studies suggested that the 3rd member of badaowan formation of the lower jurassic in the baikouquan area of junggar basin be a meandering fluvial delta .
according to the texture , sedimentary structure and distribution pattern of the sandstones , the authors believed that it is the product of a traction current with fairly strong hydrodynamic conditions and belonging to a braided fluvial delta .
three subfacies and six microfacies were recognized , including subfacies of distributary channel , flood plain and swamp , subaqueous distributary channel , interdistributary bay , mouth bar and prodelta clay .
based on the distribution pattern of sedimentary facies and its evolution , it is revealed that the braided fluvial deltaic system was formed during a water level falling period . in the early stage , the study area was occupied by the braided delta front and braided delta plain ;
and in the middle stage , the water level continued to fall , the study area was covered by a braided deltaic plain .
the northwest halaalate mountains , delun mountains and zhayier mountains were the main provenance of sediments
this paper analyzed the 1 ∶ 50000 rock-scrap data obtained from northwestern china , using the r-mode factor analysis method . geochemical subdivisions were carried out with the extracted five representative factors from the data .
then the authors decided factor f3 ( cu-zn-ag ) which was related to mineralization , in comparison with regional mineralization characteristics , geological conditions and mineralization in the study area .
geochemical anomalies were extracted with the factor analysis method based on mapgis digital elevation model . the result suggests that the anomalies are well consistent with 76 % cu mineralizations , raising the efficiency by 10 % in comparison with the single element copper geochemical anomalies .
the main anomalies are located in gongpoquan group , particularly in the contact zone with parts of magmatic rocks . mineralizations were found in most of the anomalies .

in order to predict exactly lithological characteristics at underground projects in an alluvial-fan , it is necessary to know the spatial distribution configuration of the strata by measuring the attitudes accurately .
but as the conventional measuring apparatus in field investigation geologic compass cannot satisfy such requirements for the special purpose . the authors developed a new method to determine the strata attitudes by acquiring the multi-point spatial coordinates of special surface-like geological elements with high-resolution gps
large permian and triassic carbonate gas reservoirs in the sichuan basin can be classified into 3 types , namely reef-bank gas reservoirs on platform margin , grain bank and dolomite reservoirs within platform , and weathering crust compound trap reservoirs .
the analysis of their gas accumulation patterns is significant for identifying future exploration targets .
the reef-bank gas reservoirs on the platform margin are obviously controlled by sedimentary facies . the process of hydrocarbon generation and accumulation is controlled by the paleohighs and current structures . this type of reservoirs is featured by early hydrocarbon migration and accumulation and late adjustment .
the grain bank and dolomite reservoirs within the platform are mostly formed at the late stage .
the superimposition of multiple thin reservoirs and effective fault carrier systems are critical to the formation of large scale gas reservoirs .
the weathering crust compound trap reservoirs are featured by superimposition of grain stones and hypergenetic karstification , which are critical to the formation of weathering crust reservoirs .
the weathering crust improved the conditions of source rocks , reservoirs , traps and seal combinations , so the contact between faults and formations resulted in many modes of hydrocarbon charging from fault plane , flank , and top side . this type of gas reservoirs was formed in the early stage and modified in the late stage
the nandan-hechi metallogenic belt , consisting of mangchang , dachang and wuxu ore fields , is an important tin-polymetallic metallogenic belt in south china .
based on detailed field investigations , the ore-controlling styles of this belt can be classified into as follows : , ( 1 ) &quot; maanshan style &quot; , typical ore-controlling structure in the mangchang ore field , with veins in the upper portion and strata in the lower portion , dominated by vein-like orebod- ies ;
( 2 ) &quot; tongkeng style &quot; , typical ore-controlling structure in the dachang ore field , also with veins in the upper portion and strata in the lower portion , but dominated by layered orebodies ; ( 3 ) &quot; jianzhupo style &quot; , typical ore-controlling structure in the wuxu ore field , dominated by vein-like orebodies .
moreover , the geological setting and structure characteristics of different ore-controlling styles are discussed .
according to these ore-controlling styles , it is suggested that some places , such as the northwestern maanshan pb-zn ore deposit in the mangchang ore field , and the east and south of the jianzhupo pb -zn ore deposit in the wuxu ore deposit , are probably the loci of concealed orebodies
the sediments samples in the shallow sea wetland of jiaozhou bay were collected in feb , may , aug and nov , 2009 . the concentrations of hchs and ddts in the sediments were determined .
the results showed that : ( 1 ) the concentration of hchs in the surface sediments from tideland area was from 17.56 * 10-9 to 77.39 * 10-9 , meanwhile ddts was from undetected to 89.87 * 10-9 .
the concentrations of hchs and ddts in the surface sediments from shallow sea were from undetected to 62.71 * 10-9 , and from undetected to 73.43 * 10-9 , respectely .
( 2 ) it was relatively clear that the concentrations of hchs and ddts at each station were changed with seasons , and their changes were as same as the flows &apos; changes of the rivers which flow into jiaozhou bay .
they were higher in aug when the rainfall was plentiful , and were lower in feb , may and nov when the rainfall was not enough . ( 3 ) the concentration distributions of hchs and ddts in sediments in the whole research sea area were relatively scattered and there was not an intensive pollution source , which meant that the research sea area were area polluted

this paper presents a fast forward calculation method of gravity and magnetic anomalies for 3d arbitrary bodies based on gpu.the surface is subdivided into a large number of regular voxels .
for any 3d arbitrary body , the total volume can be combined by these voxels with fixed size and unknown physical properties ( density or susceptibility ) .
the gravity ( magnetic ) anomaly of these voxels at the surface points can be computed by the analytical method .
the sum of the above gravity ( magnetic ) anomaly of each voxel can represent the anomaly of the whole arbitrary body .
for the purpose of improving the approximation , the subsurface should be divided into a larger number of voxels .
the authors have adopted gpu parallel method for forward calculation because the traditional cpu program is time-consuming .
the result shows that the forward calculation by gpu has correct results and improved efficiency . the idea can provide the basis for 3d inversion of gravity and magnetic anomaly
submarine groundwater discharge ( sgd ) is an important pathway for terrestrial material transferring to coastal sea .
the shoreline is very long in china . thus , there are important theoretic and practical meanings to accurately evaluate sgd and their potential effects to the ecological environment in coasts of china .
the study area was in a gulf in zhujiajian , zhoushan , zhejiang province . groundwater and sea water were sampled and analyzed during winter and summer , the dry and rainy season .

a group of improving methods for the on-ground calibration of solar backscattered ultraviolet spectroradiometer ( sbus ) has been put forward to increase its precision of on-board detection and data inversion .
the full-waveband radiometric calibration in vacuum , which can attain correspondence match of condition between on-ground calibration and on-board detection , is the first item .
a spectral irradiance responsibility comparing measurement setup is built and the spectral irradiance response of sbus to a same source is measured in air and vacuum , respectively .
the result shows a 0.8 % relative deviation between air and vacuum in 250 ~ 300 nm and a wavelength dependent deviation , among which the maximum is a little more than 15 % , in 300 ~ 400 nm .
the individual uncertainty caused by calibration condition of sbus in vacuum is 1.8 % smaller than that in air .
after theoretical analysis and confirmatory testing , it is found that the spectral reflectivity of al + mgf2 coating of sbus reflecting element would be different in air and in vacuum , which proves the necessity of sbus calibration in vacuum condition
selenium speciation in root soil samples collected from the poyang lake basin of jiangxi province was investigated in this paper .
the results show a significant positive correlation between the species and total amounts of selenium in root soil . the residue species of selenium occupies 12.32 % of total selenium , and the species of bound-state humic acid approximately accounts for 66.23 % of the total amount of selenium in root soil .
meanwhile , selenium abundance in root soil insignificantly varies with the change of ph value but is significantly influenced by organic content .
it is held that the process of selenium adsorption in soil organic substance and clay mineral causes selenium enrichment in root soil .
this paper has proposed a method for estimating speciation concentration of selenium according to the total selenium and established a formula to calculate available selenium content with given data of selenium abundance and speciation in soils .
in addition , a suggestion is put forward that only selenium species of organic bound , residue , water soluble and total amount of selenium should be considered in soil selenium assessment
a group of a-type granite has been found in recent years in the middle segment of the bangonghu-nujiang suture . these granite bodies occur as stocks with exposed areas of less than 1 km2 . lithologically , these a-type granites include two types of biotite granite and granodiorite porphyry , which intrude into cretaceous sedimentary rocks .
petrogeochemically the a-type granites have high sio2 contents , varying from 68.62 % – 75.36 % , relatively high feot ( 0.86 % – 5.39 % ) and low al2o3 ( 12.76 % – 15.54 % ) contents , displaying weak peraluminous and metaluminous characteristics .
trace element n-morb-normalized spider diagram displays apparent enrichments of large ion lithophile elements ( lile ) rb , th , u , k , pb with ba and sr of marked depletions .
high field strength elements ( hfse ) nb , ta and ti are sharply depleted with relative enrichments of zr and hf .
all of these are characteristics of a-type granite , which are different from arc granite .
these granites have high ree contents ( ∑ ree = 122 – 291 μg / g with an average of 201 μg / g ) .
light ree are rich relative to heavy ree ( lree / hree = 4.89 – 9.58 , with an average of 5.93 ) and negative eu anomalies are sharp ( δeu = 0.14 – 0.54 , with a mean value of 0.34 ) , with slightly right-dipping v-type chondrite-normalized rare earth element patterns .
zircon u-pb la-icp-ms dating for the three granite bodies yielded weighted mean ages of ( 109.6 ± 1.4 ) ma ( mswd = 3.7 ) , ( 112.2 ± 0.9 ) ma ( mswd = 0.06 ) and ( 113.7 ± 0.5 ) ma ( mswd = 0.21 ) , respectively , and indicates that they formed in the late stage of the early cretaceous .
from their zircon u-pb ages and post-collisional a2-type signatures , the authors infer that the bangonghu-nujiang middle tethys ocean should be closed at least in the beginning of the early cretaceous

chemical analysis method , refection polarizing microscope ( pmr-pol ) , x-ray diffraction ( xrd ) , analysis type scanning electron microscope ( sem ) , and electron microprobe analysis ( empa ) to study the technological mineralogy and sorting properties of gold ore in jiaodong altered rock-type has been comprehensively applied .
the results show that the technological type of this ore belongs to low sulfide and gold-bearing pyrite .
66.7 % of the gold occurred in the natural form , with electrum making up the remaining 33.33 % .
the average purity of gold in this ore was 720.44 , natural gold was 829.72 , and electrum was 784.77 .
pyrite was the major carrier of gold .
the gold was primarily of fine or ulter-fine particles in the range of 5-37μm . the accumulation volume in this range of sizes was 99.83 % . gold in this ore is easy to liberate .
under the condition of about 55 % -65 % with coarse grinding less than 75μm , the disaggregation rate of gold in natural form and sulfide inclusion forms can reach about 94 % and obtain a good flotation index in the process of flotation
the lipids biomarkers were used wildly to reconstruct the pale-environment , but their form distributions varied distinctly in different sediments , so in this study , free and oh-labile lipids of surfacial sediments in southern coastal area of shandong peninsula were investigated .
the results showed that the fatty acids were obvious in even carbon number predominance , with c16 fatty acids as the main peak and characteristic of single peak distribution , hydrocarbons were also characteristic of single peak and c29 was the main hydrocarbon .
the fatty acids and sterols were mainly from autochthonous input , but the terrestrial input was the main source of hydrocarbons in the sediments .
the fatty acids existed as bound forms in majority , the differences in structure and source could be the primary factors that influenced the form distributions of fatty acids , sterols and hydrocarbons mainly existed in free forms , and ucm peaks only emerged in chromatograms of free hydrocarbons fractions
through the analysis of hydrocarbon migration pathway system of f , y oil layers and putaohua layer in shangjia oilfield , it is found that there are two types of migration pathway systems , simple fault type and fault-sandbody compound type .
by studying on effectiveness of migration pathway systems in shangjia oilfield , it is shown that the special morphology of structure controls the hydrocarbon migration direction of migration pathway systems , positive structure hinge line is the main passageway for hydrocarbon migrating laterally from qingshankou formation in sanzhao depression to shangjia area and accumulation places .
meanwhile , it is the rational matching of hydrocarbon migration pathway system with the various control factors of hydrocarbon accumulation in time and space that determines the hydrocarbon accumulation and reservoir formation of shangjia oilfield .
the transporting capacity variation of the simple fault migration pathway systems is of periodic episodic characteristics , while the transporting capacity of the fault-sandbody compound migration pathway systems is controlled mainly by the connection modes of faults with sandbodies and the transporting capacity of the sandbodies themselves .
the hydrocarbon migration pathway systems with the continuous joint mode and malposed joint mode between direction fault or antithetic fault and sandbody have lateral transporting capacity , while the hydrocarbon migration pathway systems with the discrete joint mode between antithetic fault and sandbody have no lateral transporting capacity .
the calculation of effective pathway space factor and the statistics of oil show layers in each reservoir group show that fu-1 reservoir sandbody of fuyu oil reservoir and yang-1 reservoir sandbody of yangdachengzi oil reservoir all have good lateral hydrocarbon transporting capacity
block j16 is an arch structure retained by two northern and southern downthrow faults . the reservoirs have fine sandstones and pebbled inequigranular sandstones mainly with high porosity and high permeability .
